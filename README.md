Project on Medicare fraud detection using Python, Power BI, and compliance workflows.
# Medicare Fraud Detection – A Data-Driven Strategy

Capstone project focused on building a fraud detection framework using real-world Medicare-like datasets. Combines Python-based data analysis, Power BI dashboards, and GRC workflows.

🔍 Project Objective

Healthcare fraud costs the U.S. billions annually. Our goal: detect high-risk providers and billing anomalies using a data-driven, scalable framework.

🧠 What We Built

Data Pipeline – Cleaned and modeled claims, providers, payments, and patients data using Python
Fraud Dashboards – Power BI dashboards for detecting outliers and ranking provider risk
GRC Workflows – Created audit personas, fraud scoring, and CMS-aligned compliance metrics
Strategic Models – Included OKRs, Balanced Scorecard, and Business Model Canvas


📊 Results

- Flagged abnormal billing behaviors with data profiling
- Simulated risk scoring models used in fraud detection
- Empowered fraud investigators via interactive dashboards

🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Power BI
- SQL (basic)
- Excel
- Strategic frameworks (OKRs, BSC)
